# Graph Algorithms
Implemented Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm when traversing through tree or graph data structures when searching for the nearest hospital in a locality map

## Problem Statement 
In a given number of nodes (i.e. the locality map), traverse the neighbouring nodes to find the nearest hospital node from a starting node 

## Functionality
1. Implemented the BFS algorithm to find the nearest hospital node by controlling the following variables 
      a. Total number of nodes - n
      b. Number of hospitals - h
      c. Number of hospitals to be searched - k

## Conclusion
1.
